## Claim: no-go!

**Claim: NO global symmetries in "quantum gravity"!**

What?! Why? Intuition: the charge of global symmetry:

$$
  Q[R] = \int_R \dd[3]{x} J^0
$$

Scales with **volume**, while the d.o.f. of a black hole scale with **area** --- Bekenstein--Hawking bound $S_{BH}$; i.e. obstruction comes from the holographic nature of black holes.

**Ideas:**

- Black holes $\leadsto$ holographic systems: area law. Low dim "quantum gravity" without black holes provides some counter examples to this claim (see HS, Section 2):
  - pt particle with einbein action
  - string worldsheet
  - (1+1) dim _canonically quantized_ JT
    - there are "remnants" that exceeds $S_{BH}$
    - _not_ a holographic theory!
    - global symmetries: allowed
- Counter counter example: JT quantized by Euclidean path integral
  - JT gravity as a matrix integral: not
  - JT treated as effective field theory
  - no remnants in the end!
  - additional "island" contributions dominate at late times
  - information "escapes" through Euclidean wormhole
- Some charges also scale with area, e.g. electric charge:

  $$
    Q[R] = \int_{\,\boxed{\scriptsize \pd R}}
      \vec{E}\cdot \dd{\vec{A}}
  $$

  This is just Gauss's law. Therefore (some) gauge symmetries are allowed --- those are the so-called _"long-range"_ gauge symmetry.

**Remark: "quantum gravity"** in the **Claim** above should have the following properties:

1. Bekenstein--Hawking bound holds
2. The theory is "holographic"
3. It can be constructed with Euclidean path integral

Relations of these properties? Obviously (2) implies (1), but others are not clear.

**Conjecture:** Euclidean path integral is consistent with a UV completion that is _holographic_.

## Proof with AdS/CFT

**Tool: entanglement wedge (EW) reconstruction / subregion duality**

Global charge is in fact, "local" :joy: --- it can be localized in some finite region with insertions of charged operators. We _define_ global symmetry to act pointwise on _local_ fields:

$$
  U^\dagger(g)\,\mcal{O}(x)\,U(g)
  = D_n{}^m(g)\,\mcal{O}_m(x)
$$

**Proof:**
Bulk global symmetry $\leadsto$ boundary global symmetry $U(g)$; local action:
  
$$
  U(g)
  = U(g,R_1)\cdots U(g,R_n)
$$

$U(g,R_i)$ only has non-trivial action on $R_i$.
However, we can choose $R_i$ so that the EW contains no insertion! Hence:

$$
  U(g,R_i) \sim \idty,
  \quad\forall\ i,
  \label{eq:trivial_action}
$$

Hence $U(g) \sim \idty$, no non-trivial global symmetry. $\ \blacksquare$

**Subtleties: many!** One interesting thing related to quantum error correction (QEC): \eqref{eq:trivial_action} only holds in some code subspace $\mcal{H}_{\text{code}}$. Don't worry! This holds in $\mcal{H}_{\text{code}}$ and $\mcal{H}_{\text{phys}}$:

$$
  \mel{0}{\phi^\dagger U^\dagger \phi\,U}{0}
  = \mel{0}{\phi^\dagger \phi}{0}
$$

This is due to the fact that $\ket{0}, \phi\ket{0} \in \mcal{H}_{\text{code}}$.
