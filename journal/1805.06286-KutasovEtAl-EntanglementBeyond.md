# [1805.06286] [Chakrabortya, Giveona, Itzhakib, Kutasov] Entanglement beyond AdS

<!-- @import "/assets/mathjax.html" -->

### A Different $T\overline{T}$ Duality

- **Different sign** from H. Verlinde et al [1611.03470], or Silverstein et al [1909.13808].

- **Different dual geometry:** $\mcal{M}_3\times \mcal{N}$, AdS now sits in the *interior* while near the boundary we have a linear dilaton background. In other words,

  - IR: small $U,\ \mcal{M}_3 = \mrm{AdS}_3$
  - UV: large $U,\ \mcal{M}_3 = \mathbb{R}^{1,1}\times \mathbb{R} _\phi$

  No longer a cutoff geometry, except a $U_{\max}$ manually introduced for regularization.

- There is a **minimum entanglement length** $L_{\min}$: as the peak of the minimal surface $U_0\to\infty$, $L$ does not shrink to zero but is bounded from below: $L\to L_{\min}$. See Fig 1.

- The notation is slightly misleading: note that $U_{\max}$ does not correspond to $L_{\min}$; $U_{\max}$ is manually introduced, while $L_{\min}$ can be found as $U\to\infty$, _without  any cutoff!_

## C-function

Cutoff-independent C-function (per CGIK's convention; Silverstein does not have this extra pre-factor of 3):

$$
  C(L) = 3L\,\pdv{S_{EE}(L)}{L}
  \tag{CGIK, 1.2}
$$

Field theory calculation, similar to Donnelly & Shyam, [1806.07444]:

- Deformation parameter: $\lambda$, or $(-\mu)$ in [1806.07444]. Trace flow equation (1.3) should be independent of $(\mop{sign} \lambda)$. Solution of $T_{ab}$ is given by (2.2).

- $\pdv{\,\log Z}{L}$ is related to $T^a_a$; with Kutasov et al's convention, we get:

  $$
    L\,\pdv{\,\log Z}{L}
    = -\frac{2L^2}{\lambda} \pqty{
      \sqrt{1 - \frac{c\lambda}{3L^2}} - 1
    }, \\
    \pdv{\,\log Z}{L}
    = -\frac{2}{\lambda} \pqty{
      \sqrt{L^2 - \frac{c\lambda}{3}} - L
    }, \tag{DS, 2.3$'$}
  $$

  The square root is real iff.
  $$
    L \ge L_0
    = \sqrt{\frac{c\lambda}{3}}
    \label{eq:ft_length_bound}
  $$

  > **Conventions:**
  >
  > - [1806.07444] Donnelly & Shyam: $L = 2r,\ \mu = -2\pi\lambda$
  > - [1909.13808] Silverstein et al: $L = 2r$

- Compare (cf. PengXiang's note):

  $$
    L_0
    = \sqrt{\frac{6k\cdot 2\alpha'}{3}}
    = 2\sqrt{k\alpha'}, \\
    L_{\min}
    = \frac{\pi}{2}\sqrt{k\alpha'}
    = 1.57 \sqrt{k\alpha'},
  $$

  If I've got their conventions right, then **they don't match quantitatively**. _But I am confused about conventions so I could be wrong!_

  Note: $L_{\min}$ is the lower bound produced from holography (RT) by Kutasov et al. Here $k$ is the level of the _worldsheet_ $\mathrm{SL}(2,\mathbb{R})$ current algebra.

  > **Correspondence:** $c = 6k,\ \lambda = 2\alpha'$. _Why?_ I have not yet understood this, might need to check Kutasov's original: [1701.05576].

- A convenient substitution for the integral:

  $$
    L
    = L_0 \cosh x
    = \sqrt{\frac{c\lambda}{3}} \cosh x,
  $$

  $$
  \begin{aligned}
    \log Z
    &= -\frac{2}{\lambda} \frac{c\lambda}{3}
      \int \dd{x}\,\sinh x \cdot \pqty{
        \sinh x - \cosh x
      } \\
    &\sim - \frac{c}{3}
      \pqty{
        -x - \frac{1}{2} e^{-2x}
      } \\
    &\sim \frac{c}{3}\,
      \cosh^{-1} \frac{L}{L_0}
      + \frac{L^2}{\lambda}\,\pqty{
        1 - \sqrt{1 - \pqty{\frac{L_0}{L}}^{\!\!2}}
      },
  \end{aligned}
  $$

  $$
    S
    = \pqty{
        1 - \frac{L}{2} \frac{\pd}{\pd L}
      } \log Z
    = \frac{c}{3}\,\cosh^{-1} \frac{L}{L_0},
  $$

  $$
    C(L)
    = 3L\,\pdv{S}{L}
    = \frac{c}{\sqrt{1 - \frac{c\lambda}{3L^2}}}
  $$

  **Note:** $\log Z$ and $S$ might differ by an $L$-independent "constant", but that is eliminated in $C(L)$ due to the $L$-derivative.

## RT calculation

Here we check the RT calculation, with the help of ADS (Apolo, Detournay & Song) [1911.12359] when it comes to confusing conventions.

**From now on, we default to the convention of ADS [1911.12359]**

The metric, B-field and dilation

- at finite temperature ($T_u, T_v$)
- in string frame
- in static patch

are given by ADS (3.13). Setting $T_u = T_v = 0,\ p = 1$, the asymptotically AdS part is reduced to:

$$
  \dd{s}^2
  = \ell^2 \pqty{
      \frac{\dd{r}^2}{4r^2}
      + \frac{r\dd{u}\dd{v}}{1 + 2\lambda r}
    },\\
  e^{2\Phi}
  = \frac{k}{p}
    \frac{1}{1 + 2\lambda r}\,
    e^{-2\phi_0},
\\
  u,v = \varphi \pm t/\ell,
  \tag{ADS, 3.13$'$}
  \label{eq:staticMetric}
$$

This should correspond to CGIK (2.3). The finite temperature version should roughly correspond to CGIK (5.1).

The $\lambda$ in \eqref{eq:staticMetric} is the string theory deformation parameter; by ADS (2.43) and ADS, Section 2.3, we have:

$$
  \lambda
  = \frac{k}{\ell^2} \mu,
  \quad
  k = \ell^2/\ell_s^2
  \tag{ADS, 3.13$'$}
$$

$$
  \lambda
  = \mu / \ell_s^2
  \tag{ADS, 3.38$'$}
$$

Moreover, we have $c = 6pk$ by ADS (3.7).

### Conventions

By comparing the $\abs{w} = 1$ spectrum:

$$
  E = - \frac{R}{2\mu} \Bqty{
    1 - \sqrt{
      1 + \frac{4\mu}{R} E(0)
      + \frac{4\mu^2}{R^4} J(0)
    }
  }, \tag{ADS, 3.39$'$}
$$

With the one in Silverstein et al (LLST) [1909.13808]:

$$
  E \propto E_S = \frac{2R}{\lambda_S} \Bqty{
    1 - \sqrt{
      1 - \frac{\lambda_S}{2\pi R} E(0)
      + \frac{\pi^2\lambda_S^2}{(2\pi R)^4} J(0)
    }
  },
\tag{LLST, 2.7$'$} \\
  E(0)
  = 2\pi \pqty{
      \Delta + \bar{\Delta} - \tfrac{c}{12}
    },\quad
  J(0)
  = 2\pi \pqty{
      \Delta - \bar{\Delta}
    },
$$

$\lambda_S$ is the deformation parameter in Silverstein et al's convention. We have a correspondence:

$$
  \frac{\lambda_S}{2\pi}
  = -4\mu_{\mathrm{ADS}},\quad
  \lambda_S = -8\pi\mu_{\mathrm{ADS}}, \\
  E_S = \frac{1}{2\pi} E_{\mathrm{ADS}}
$$

_Thank Luis for help with this!_ With ADS's convention, the lower bound \eqref{eq:ft_length_bound} can be expressed as:

$$
  L_0
  = \sqrt{\frac{6k\cdot 8\pi \mu}{3}}
  = 4\sqrt{k\mu}
$$

With the conventions sorted out, let's try to compute the geodesic with \eqref{eq:staticMetric}.

### Poincare Patch

**Again, we default to the convention of ADS [1911.12359]**

At first glace \eqref{eq:staticMetric} may resemble the metric in some "polar" coordinates, but in fact it's more closely related to the Poincare coordinates. Recall that the standard BTZ black hole comes from a quotient of the Poincare patch. To see this more explicitly, we can set $\ell = 1$ and take $r = \frac{1}{\rho^2}$, which gives:

$$
  \dd{s}^2
  = \frac{\dd{\rho}^2}{\rho^2}
    + \frac{\dd{u}\dd{v}}{\rho^2 + 2\lambda},\\
  e^{2\Phi}
  = \frac{k}{p}
    \frac{\rho^2}{\rho^2 + 2\lambda}\,
    e^{-2\phi_0},
  \tag{ADS, 3.13$''$}
  \label{eq:staticMetricPoincare}
$$

_Again thank Luis for help with this!_

### RT with dilaton

The RT proposal needs to be generalized in the presence of dilatons; an updated proposal was introduced by R & T themselves in Section 7.7 of [hep-th/0605073]; see Section 3.3 of Peng-Xiang's note. This is the proposal adopted by Kutasov et al.

More specifically, the "generalized area" of the RT surface in (bulk) 3D is modified by including a dilaton factor:

$$
L_E
= \int \dd{\tau}\,e^{-2\Phi} \sqrt{
    g_{\mu\nu}
    \pd_\tau X^\mu
    \pd_\tau X^\nu
  }
= \int \dd{\tau} \sqrt{
    G_{\mu\nu}
    \pd_\tau X^\mu
    \pd_\tau X^\nu
  }
$$

Which we would like to minimize. Here $g_{\mu\nu}$ is the string-frame metric, while $G_{\mu\nu}$ is the Einstein-frame metric;

$$
  G_{\mu\nu}
  = e^{-4\Phi} g_{\mu\nu},\\
$$

Basically $L_E$ is the Einstein-frame length; this $e^{-2\Phi}$ is the same as the one in the _spacetime effective action:_ $\cdots\int e^{-2\Phi}\,\mathcal{R}\cdots$

We have:

$$
  \dd{s}^2_E
  = \pqty{
      \frac{\rho^2 + 2\lambda}{\rho^2}
    }^{\!\!2}
    \pqty{
      \frac{\dd{\rho}^2}{\rho^2}
      + \frac{\dd{u}\dd{v}}{\rho^2 + 2\lambda}
    }
$$

The minimal surface / geodesic $(t,\rho,\varphi)_\tau$ at the $t = 0$ slice is constrained as follows:

$$
  t = 0 = u - v, \\
  p_\varphi = \mathrm{const.}
  = \pqty{
      \frac{\rho^2 + 2\lambda}{\rho^2}
    }^{\!\!2}
    \frac{1}{\rho^2 + 2\lambda}\,
    \dot{\varphi},\\
  p_\mu p^\mu
  = \pqty{
      \frac{\rho^2 + 2\lambda}{\rho^2}
    }^{\!\!2}
    \pqty{
      \frac{\dot{\rho}^2}{\rho^2}
      + \frac{\dot{\varphi}^2}{\rho^2 + 2\lambda}
    }
  = 1
$$

This $p_\varphi$ is the conserved (angular) momentum, not to be confused with the parameter $p = 1$.
This can be reduced to:

$$
  \dot{\varphi}
  = \frac{\rho^4}{\rho^2 + 2\lambda}\,
    p_\varphi,\\
  \dot{\rho}^2
  = \frac{\rho^6}{(\rho^2 + 2\lambda)^3}
    \pqty{
      \rho^2 + 2\lambda
      - p^2_\varphi \rho^4
    }
$$

Hence,

$$
  \Bqty{\rho'(\varphi)}^2
  = \frac{1}{\rho^2 p^2_\varphi}
    - \frac{\rho^2}{\rho^2 + 2\lambda}
$$

w.l.o.g, let's assume that entanglement entropy peaks at $\varphi = 0, \rho = \rho_0$; we have $\rho'(0) = 0$, and we can express $p_\varphi$ in terms of the more geometric parameter $\rho_0$:

$$
  p_\varphi
  = \frac{\sqrt{\rho_0^2 + 2\lambda}}{\rho_0^2}
$$

$$
  \Bqty{\rho'(\varphi)}^2
  = \frac{\rho_0^2}{\rho^2}
    \frac{\rho_0^2}{\rho_0^2 + 2\lambda}
    - \frac{\rho^2}{\rho^2 + 2\lambda}
$$

The length $L$ of the entanglement region at the boundary should be computed in the usual string frame; we have:

$$
\begin{aligned}
  L
  &= \int \frac{\dd{\varphi}}{\sqrt{2\lambda}} \\
  &= 2\int_0^{\rho_0}
      \frac{1}{\sqrt{2\lambda}}
      \abs{\dv{\varphi}{\rho}}
      \dd{\rho},
    \quad \rho = \frac{1}{r} \\
  &= \sqrt{\frac{2}{\lambda}}
    \int_{r_0}^{\infty}
      \frac{
        \sqrt{1 + 2\lambda r^2}
      }{
        \sqrt{
          \frac{r^2}{r_0^2}
          \frac{
              1 + 2\lambda r^2
            }{1 + 2\lambda r_0^2}
          - 1
        }
      }
      \frac{\dd{r}}{r^2} \\
  &= \sqrt{\frac{2}{\lambda r_0^2}}
    \int_{1}^{\infty}
      \frac{
        \sqrt{1 + 2\lambda r_0^2 y^2}
      }{
        y^2 \sqrt{
          y^2 \frac{
            1 + 2\lambda r_0^2 y^2
          }{1 + 2\lambda r_0^2}
          - 1
        }
      }\,
      \dd{y} \\
\end{aligned}
$$

As $r_0 \to \infty$, we have:

$$
  L \ge L_{\min}
  = \frac{1}{r_0}
    \sqrt{\frac{2}{\lambda}}
    \sqrt{2\lambda r_0^2}
    \int_{1}^{\infty}
      \frac{y}{y^2 \sqrt{y^4 - 1}}\,
      \dd{y}
  = \frac{\pi}{2}
  = \frac{\pi}{2}\,\ell
$$

This is weird:

- The result seems to be independent of the deformation parameter; however, note that:

  $$
    \ell
    = \ell_s \sqrt{k}
    = \sqrt{k\alpha'}
  $$

  Which does agrees with Kutasov's result. I don't know how to understand this...

- The general formula for $L$ does agree with Kutasov's (3.3), with $2\lambda r_0^2 \leftrightarrow  kU_0^2$, and $\ell = 1$. TODO: match the metric conventions explicitly.
