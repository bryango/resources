# [2002.08950] [Marolf, Maxfield] Transcending the ensemble

<!-- @import "/assets/mathjax.html" -->

## Synopsis

- An **instruction manual** of constructing the baby universe Hilbert space $\mathcal{H}_{\mathrm{BU}}$, with detailed calculations in a toy model: topological 2D gravity.

## Concepts

- **Baby universe (BU):** Spacetime with compact Cauchy surfaces, i.e. has no (asymptotic) boundary. Arise when considering _spacetime wormholes_.

- **Spacetime wormholes:** geometry localized in _both_ space and time. Differ from **spatial wormholes** - the ones found in a maximally extended Lorentzian Schwarzschild black hole.

- We work in Euclidean signature, thus "spacetime wormholes" are **Euclidean wormholes**. _In principle,_ the formalism here applies to either signature.

## Setup

- $g_{\mu\nu} \in \Phi$: a set of bulk fields, boundary condition labeled by $J$: $\Phi\sim J$.
- Boundary condition $\to$ _smeared_ operator insertion:

  $$
    \int_{\pd B}
      \dd^n{x}\,
      J(x)\,\hat{\mathcal{O}}(x)
  $$

  Contraction of indices suppressed: $
    J(x)\,\hat{\mathcal{O}}(x)
    = J_\bullet(x)\,\hat{\mathcal{O}}^\bullet(x)
  $.

- Gravitational path integral $\to$ partition function $Z[J]$, promoted to the VEV of an exponential operator: $\langle \hat{Z}[J] \rangle$.

  > Recall the usual **AdS/CFT dictionary:**
  >
  > $$ \ave{\hat{Z}[J]}_{\pd B}
      = \mathcal{Z}_{B}
        \bqty{\Phi|_{\pd B}\sim J},\quad
      B = \mathrm{Bulk} $$
  >
  > The partition function of the boundary $Z[J]$ is promoted to an operator exponential:
  >
  > $$ \hat{Z}[J]
      \sim \exp \int_{\pd B}
        \dd^n{x}\,J(x)\,\hat{\mathcal{O}}(x) $$

- Without AdS/CFT, we can nevertheless _**define the notation:**_

  $$ \ave{
      \hat{Z}[J_1]\cdots
      \hat{Z}[J_n]
    } \equiv \int_{
        B, \ \Phi|_{\pd B_i}\sim J_i
      }
      \DD\Phi\,e^{-S[\Phi]}
  \tag{2.1} $$

  With $n$ boundary components. Here AdS/CFT serves as the original motivation, but the formalism by itself can be developed in a self-consistent way without duality.

- In fact, $\ave{\cdots}$ involving multiple boundaries can _**not**_ be interpreted as a standard AdS/CFT correlator, since:

  $$
    \ave{Z[J_1] Z[J_2]}
    \ne \ave{Z[J_1]} \ave{Z[J_2]}
    \tag{2.2}
  $$

  > In standard AdS/CFT, we **should expect $\ave{Z[J_1] Z[J_2]}$ to factorize**, since it's the partition function between two **local, Euclidean** field theory. See the discussions in:
  >
  > - [0705.2768] _Nima, Orgera & Polchinski:_ The ends of a wormhole can be arbitrarily separated in time, so that amplitudes will not satisfy cluster decomposition, whereas the dual gauge theory has local time evolution and so will satisfy cluster decomposition.
  >
  > - [hep-th/0401024] _Maldacena and Maoz:_ Lorentzian geometries with multiple asymptotic boundaries are such that boundaries are separated by horizons (this is called _topological censorship_, see hep-th/9912119), as long as the boundaries have more than one dimension. In this case one can interpret the geometries as dual to entangled states of the various field theories living on each boundary. _Example: TFD._
  >
  > **My understanding:** There are no horizons in Euclidean spacetime, hence there is no such thing as an entangled background.

  Then how should we interpret $\ave{\cdots}$? **Answer:** ensemble average over a family of theories. **Why?** We neglect something that "purifies" the ensemble in the usual AdS/CFT picture --- the BU states.

- BU has no boundary ($\varnothing$), hence is (falsely) neglected in the dual description. We can recover its contribution by explicit construction of the BU Hilbert space (a sector of the full Hilbert space).

## Construction of $\mathcal{H}_{\mathrm{BU}}$

- States are obtained by cutting open correlators, which are defined by gravitational path integral (2.1).

  $$
    \ave{
      Z[\tilde{J}_1]\cdots
      Z[\tilde{J}_2]
      \big|
      Z[J_1]\cdots Z[J_m]
    }
    = \ave{
      Z[\tilde{J}^*_1]\cdots
      Z[\tilde{J}^*_2]\,
      Z[J_1]\cdots Z[J_m]
    }
    \tag{2.5}
  $$

- No boundaries ($m = 0$): Hartle-Hawking state $\ket{HH}$

  <center>
    $\bra{\mathrm{HH}}\ket{\mathrm{HH}} = $ <img
      src="img/HH-geometries.png"
      style="width: 18rem; vertical-align: middle"
    /> $ + \cdots$
    <br/>
  </center>

- Define $\widehat{Z[J]}$ as creation operator:

  $$
    \ket{Z[J_1]\cdots Z[J_m]}
    = \widehat{Z[J_1]} \cdots
      \widehat{Z[J_m]}
      \ket{\mathrm{HH}}
    \tag{2.12}
  $$

  Intuitively, $\widehat{Z[J]}$ adds a boundary component to the previous state. Note that permutations of $J_i$ does not change the path integral / state, which means that:

  $$
    \bqty{
      \widehat{Z[J]}, \widehat{Z[J']}
    } = 0
  $$

  Also by (2.5), $
    \widehat{Z[J]}^\dagger
    = \widehat{Z[J^*]}
  $.

  > Note that this $\widehat{Z[J]}$ has the same properties as Coleman's $A_i$ operator. Recall that Luis showed last week that summing over the BUs leads to an effective Hamiltonian:
  >
  > $$ \mathscr{H} = \mathscr{H}_0(x)
      + \sum_i \mathscr{H}_i(x) A_i,\quad
      [A_i,A_j] = 0 $$
  >
  > Here $A_i\to a_i + a^\dagger_i$ if we assume that the creation/annihilation of baby universes happens one at a time. $a^\dagger_i$ is the creation operator for a BU of some "type" $i$.

- Simultaneous eigenstates of $\widehat{Z[J]}$ --- $\alpha$-states:

  $$
    \widehat{Z[J]} \ket{\alpha}
    = Z_\alpha[J] \ket{\alpha},\quad
    \forall\ J\colon\ \text{all kinds of b.c.}
  $$

  $α$-states define a preferred orthonormal basis for $\mathcal{H}_ {\mathrm{BU}}$; by inserting $
      \sum_\alpha \ket{\alpha}\bra{\alpha}
    $, we find that:

  $$ \ave{
      Z[J_1]\cdots Z[J_n]
    } = \ave{1}
        \sum_\alpha p_\alpha
          Z_\alpha[J_1]\cdots Z_\alpha[J_n]
    \tag{2.22}
  $$

  Here $
    p_\alpha = \abs{
        \bra{\mathrm{HH}}\ket{\alpha}
      }^2 / \ave{1},
    \ave{1} = \bra{HH}\ket{HH}
  $.

- **Ensemble interpretation:** the parameters $α$ label the various theories in the ensemble, the eigenvalues $Z_α [J]$ give definite values for observables in the theory associated with the particular label $α$, and $p_α$ gives the probability of selecting $α$ from the ensemble.

- $\{\alpha\}$ are in one-to-one correspondence with members of the ensemble, and $\mop{span} \{\alpha\} = \mathcal{H}_{\mathrm{BU}}$.

  > Entanglement with BU typically led the rest of the theory (here the asymptotically AdS sector) to act as if it were part of an ensemble of theories. However, a particular member of the ensemble could be chosen by selecting an appropriate baby universe state ($\ket{\alpha}$).
