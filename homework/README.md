# Homework
This is a repo for dumping homework, released under CC-BY-NC-SA 4.0. 

PDF is usually compiled using `xelatex` & `biber`. However, if there are Feynman diagrams created with `tikz-feynman`, they should be compiled using `lualatex`. The LaTeX engine to use is specified with a _magic comment_, e.g.
```latex
% !TeX TS-program = lualatex
```

For PDFs, please go check [Releases](https://github.com/bryango/Homework/releases/latest); also hosted on:
- https://bryango.github.io/resources/homework, a simple tree view built with pages;
- https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/bryango/resources/homework/, auto-generated by jsDelivr.

PDFs are generated by Github actions & workflows; for implementations, see `.github/`.
